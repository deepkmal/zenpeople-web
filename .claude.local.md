# ZenPeople Project Guidelines

## Project Overview
ZenPeople is a specialist recruitment agency for the facade and glazing industry in Australia.
This is the marketing website built with Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack
- Vite + React (TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- lucide-react for icons
- react-router-dom for routing
- Embla Carousel for testimonials
- Sanity CMS (Phase 2) for job management

## Design System

### Colors
- Navy: `#1E3A5F` (primary brand color, headers, buttons)
- Orange: `#E86A33` (accent, logo "Zen", highlights)
- White, Gray-50, Gray-100 (backgrounds)
- Gray-500, Gray-600, Gray-700 (text)

### Typography
- Font: Inter (Google Fonts)
- Weights: 400 (body), 500 (medium), 600 (semibold), 700 (bold)
- Headlines: Bold for hero, semibold for sections
- Case: Sentence case for section headings

### Aesthetic
- Classic, authoritative, professional
- "Make us look bigger than we are - national, experts"
- Reference sites: Randstad, Openwork.com, Michael Page
- Balanced whitespace (not excessive, not cramped)
- Professional stock photography
- Duotone icons

## Component Patterns
- Use `Container` wrapper for consistent max-width and padding
- Use `SectionHeading` for consistent section titles
- All sections should be responsive (mobile-first)
- Buttons use the `Button` component with variants

## File Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── layout/ (Header, Footer, MobileMenu, Layout)
│   ├── ui/ (Button, Container, SectionHeading)
│   ├── home/ (Hero, JobSearchBar, WhyUsSection, etc.)
│   └── shared/ (ContactSection)
├── data/ (jobs.ts, testimonials.ts, sectors.ts)
├── pages/ (HomePage.tsx)
├── App.tsx
└── index.css
```

## Images
Images are currently using placeholder SVGs. Replace with professional stock photos:
- `/public/images/hero-bg.webp` - Construction/facade scene with cranes
- `/public/images/sectors/*.webp` - Sector-specific imagery

## Development
```bash
npm run dev   # Start dev server
npm run build # Build for production
npm run lint  # Run linter
```
